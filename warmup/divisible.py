'''
Write a program that will return a list of numbers divisible by given number
in interval from a to b. The program should take 3 inputs, divisor, start and
stop points of the interval.

Example:
Input: divisor = 3, start = 3, stop = 9

Output: [3,6,9]


If divisor is 0, the result should be a string 'Cannot divide by zero'
'''

divisor = 1
start = 1
stop = 10

def main(divisor, start, stop):

    # create the variable, where you will store the result

    # check that the divisor is not zero
    # if not then iterate over the numbers between start and stop (including)
    # use modulo operator to check whether each of those numbers is divisible
    # by divisor


    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
