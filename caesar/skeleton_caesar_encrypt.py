# --> to write elegant program that encodes and decodes caesar cipher, you will
# need to use modulo operator
# --> you will need to generate alphabet
# --> iterate over each item in the message char by char and get the shifted equivalent
# from the alphabet
# --> shifted characters should be collected in a mutable sequence such as list_primes
# --> finally you will convert the list into a string and output it as a result
