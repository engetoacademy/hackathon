# --> determine whether a year is leap
# --> increase date by 1 day (think of case, when you need to know, what date is
#                            the day after 31.3.)
# --> determine number of days between two dates
# --> use one specific arithmetic operator to determine the weekday based on number of
#   days counted between the given date and 1/1/1970, what was Thursday

# represent your dates in tuple of three numbers (year,month,day)
